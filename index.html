        <div id="ftc-info-text-field" style="background-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); border-radius:2vh; width:80%; padding:2vh; line-height: 5vh; max-width:80%; margin:0 auto">
            <p><b>FTC stands for FIRST Tech Challenge, a robotics competition for middle and high school students that blends the thrill of sports with the rigors of science and technology. In FTC, teams of students design, build, and program robots to compete in an annual game that changes every season. The robots are typically small, no larger than 18 inches on each side, and are controlled using a combination of pre-written code and driver input through gamepads. Teams also document their engineering process, work on community outreach, and often collaborate with mentors and sponsors. The goal isnâ€™t just to win matches, but to develop teamwork, problem-solving, and real-world engineering skills.</b></p>
